# Spotify_Top10_WebApp
A simple web app that allows a Spotify user to see their 10 most listened to songs of the last month

To start, go to developer.spotify.com/dashboard and create an app

Next edit settings and add your localhost to the list of verified redirect URI's

Finally, copy and paste your client_id and client_secret into the appropriate variables or text fields
^(SEE LINE 107 OF SCRIPT.JS IF CONFUSED)^

If everything was done properly your top 10 songs should appear along with artist names and album covers

PLEASE NOTE:  This process is to run this web app on your localhost, this requires that all the files from this repo
              are in the appropriate folder (wherever your machine looks for it's local server) and also requires that
              your localhost is enabled
